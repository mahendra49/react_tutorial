var promise=new Promise(function(resolve,reject){
	
});


promise.then(function(){}).catch(function(){});

Benefits of Promises:
	Improves Code Readability
	Better handling of asynchronous operations
	Better flow of control definition in asynchronous logic
	Better Error Handling

A Promise has four states:
	fulfilled: Action related to the promise succeeded
	rejected: Action related to the promise failed
	pending: Promise is still pending i.e not fulfilled or rejected yet
	settled: Promise has fulfilled or rejected
	
Applications:
	Promises are used for asynchronous handling of events.
	Promises are used to handle asynchronous http requests.
